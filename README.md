# Password-Generator

This 3rd´s week assignment required us to work in a Random Generator, specifically in a password. 

1. There was inital HTML and CSS code given, so all I had to do was modify the JS file. Which also included a couple of variables, 
and functions related with ID's in the HTML file. 

2. The instructions were to prompt via .prompt methods, so that the user would answer on whether he needed or not some types of characters.
The included characters in the WebPage are:
    -Uppercase
    -Lowercase
    -Numbers
    -Special Characters

3. The User has the ability to first choose the length of the Password, between 8 and 128 characters. (Minimum and Maximum.)
4. After this, I created a series of .confirm, this way you can choose the characters you need.
5. If the user fails on the length, a mesagge will ask him to try again, also if he exceeds it. 
6. If he inputs a letter he will be asked to write numbers only. 
7. If he does not select any type of character he will be asked to try again and prompted to the initial "Write the number of ... for Password"
8. Whether he selects all or just 1 prompted criteria, the password will be shown in the text area. 
9. User must answer all prompts to get the final Password generated. 
10. If user changes tabs he will have to re-do the process.

11. Console logs for the fucntions are in the JS code, to read in console to know if the input by the user is TRUE or FALSE. 

With this activity I got to study the concepts seen in class, this always helps to build on what you get taught. I found myself researching
in videos, or google, to understand a method or property better. Sometimes I had to rewatch the online session to better understand this concepts. Definitely not a 1 or 2 hour homework for a beginner in Javascript. 

This was a great assignment to test our logic, and believe me I wrote more code than this, that in the end I ended up changing or deleting. 

12. What does it solve?
Its a very basic password generator, but it sure gets the job done. It can improve with external libraries, better CSS and more buttons, to be more friendly with the user. I´m thinking of adding a COPY button for the user, and buttons for the options instead of prompts to make it easier for people. 


13. SCREENSHOTS.

If you cant view the ScreenShots, there is a folder called images, where you can view the working app! :D
